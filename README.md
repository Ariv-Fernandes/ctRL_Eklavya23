# ctRL
This project intends to be an introduction to reinforcement learning based control systems. It will involve the study and implementation of classic reinforment learning algorithms, atleast one of which will running on an RPi to solve a control problem.
## About the project
This project represents our journey in reinforcement learning. It includes the implementation of problems in reinforcement learning ranging from solving a simple version of the k-armed bandits problem to a simulation of the line following bot using Q-learning algorithm.
